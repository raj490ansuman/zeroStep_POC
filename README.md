Takeaways:

- On a free trial we can use the API key for only 500 times. (which is too less)

- Using only Ai to locate and perform tests will take more time compared to do manually.

- A proper test suite setup will involve both manual locators and Ai support with prompts.
 - This will reduce the API calls as well and will be an overall fast performance as the Ai modal will not spend time looking for obvious elements and only look for certain elements which are complex to locate manually (mostly dynamic vales).
